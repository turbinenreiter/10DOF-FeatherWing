# 10DOF-FeatherWing
This is a daughter-board for Adafruit Feather. It has a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer, a pressure sensor, a boost converter to generate 5V and headers for 5 servos.

The board is NOT production ready and untested.

## TODO
Connect #9 to BAT for measuring battery voltage
? add more SRV headers (don't need ADCs anyway)
? Buttons, switches, LEDs?
